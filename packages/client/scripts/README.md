# Type Error Fixer

This powerful script automatically analyzes and fixes errors in the client codebase. It goes beyond the capabilities of standard linting tools like `yarn lint --fix` by intelligently resolving complex type issues.

## Features

- **Intelligent Type Error Resolution**: Automatically identifies and fixes common type errors
- **Interface Generation**: Generates missing interfaces with smart placeholders
- **Property Addition**: Adds missing properties to interfaces and types
- **Null/Undefined Handling**: Adds proper null checks for nullable values
- **Type Assertion**: Adds type assertions where necessary
- **Import Fixing**: Resolves missing import statements
- **Formatted Output**: All fixes are automatically formatted with Prettier

## How It Works

The script:

1. Categorizes errors by type and location
2. Applies intelligent fixes based on error type
3. Formats fixed files with Prettier
4. Provides a detailed summary of fixes applied

## Usage

Run the script from the client directory:

```bash
./fix-types.sh
```

Or directly:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/fix-type-errors.ts
```

## Supported Error Types

- Missing properties on types/interfaces
- Type mismatches
- Null/undefined errors
- Implicit any errors
- Missing imports
- Missing interfaces/types

## Notes

- For complex type errors, the script adds TODOs to mark where manual attention might be needed
- The script may need to be run multiple times for complex codebases
- Always review the changes after running to ensure they align with your intentions
